 NSURLSession is a replacement API for NSURLConnection.  It provides
 options that affect the policy of, and various aspects of the
 mechanism by which NSURLRequest objects are retrieved from the
 network.
 
 An NSURLSession may be bound to a delegate object.  The delegate is
 invoked for certain events during the lifetime of a session, such as
 server authentication or determining whether a resource to be loaded
 should be converted into a download.
 
 NSURLSession instances are threadsafe.
 
 The default NSURLSession uses a system provided delegate and is
 appropriate to use in place of existing code that uses
 +[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:queue:completionHandler:]
 
 An NSURLSession creates NSURLSessionTask objects which represent the
 action of a resource being loaded.  These are analogous to
 NSURLConnection objects but provide for more control and a unified
 delegate model.
 
 NSURLSessionTask objects are always created in a suspended state and
 must be sent the -resume message before they will execute.
 
 Subclasses of NSURLSessionTask are used to syntactically
 differentiate between data and file downloads.
 
 An NSURLSessionDataTask receives the resource as a series of calls to
 the URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData: delegate method.  This is type of
 task most commonly associated with retrieving objects for immediate parsing
 by the consumer.
 
 An NSURLSessionUploadTask differs from an NSURLSessionDataTask
 in how its instance is constructed.  Upload tasks are explicitly created
 by referencing a file or data object to upload, or by utilizing the
 -URLSession:task:needNewBodyStream: delegate message to supply an upload
 body.
 
 An NSURLSessionDownloadTask will directly write the response data to
 a temporary file.  When completed, the delegate is sent
 URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL: and given an opportunity
 to move this file to a permanent location in its sandboxed container, or to
 otherwise read the file. If canceled, an NSURLSessionDownloadTask can
 produce a data blob that can be used to resume a download at a later
 time.
 
 Beginning with iOS 9 and Mac OS X 10.11, NSURLSessionStream is
 available as a task type.  This allows for direct TCP/IP connection
 to a given host and port with optional secure handshaking and
 navigation of proxies.  Data tasks may also be upgraded to a
 NSURLSessionStream task via the HTTP Upgrade: header and appropriate
 use of the pipelining option of NSURLSessionConfiguration.  See RFC
 2817 and RFC 6455 for information about the Upgrade: header, and
 comments below on turning data tasks into stream tasks.
 */

/* DataTask objects receive the payload through zero or more delegate messages */
/* UploadTask objects receive periodic progress updates but do not return a body */
/* DownloadTask objects represent an active download to disk.  They can provide resume data when canceled. */
/* StreamTask objects may be used to create NSInput and NSOutputStreams, or used directly in reading and writing. */

/*
 
 NSURLSession is not available for i386 targets before Mac OS X 10.10.

/// # NSURLSession API implementation overview
///
/// ## Design Overview
///
/// This implementation uses libcurl for the HTTP layer implementation. At a
/// high level, the `NSURLSession` keeps a *multi handle*, and each
/// `NSURLSessionTask` has an *easy handle*. This way these two APIs somewhat
/// have a 1-to-1 mapping.
///
/// The `NSURLSessionTask` class is in charge of configuring its *easy handle*
/// and adding it to the owning session’s *multi handle*. Adding / removing
/// the handle effectively resumes / suspends the transfer.
///
/// The `NSURLSessionTask` class has subclasses, but this design puts all the
/// logic into the parent `NSURLSessionTask`.
///
/// Both the `NSURLSession` and `NSURLSessionTask` extensively use helper
/// types to ease testability, separate responsibilities, and improve
/// readability. These types are nested inside the `NSURLSession` and
/// `NSURLSessionTask` to limit their scope. Some of these even have sub-types.
///
/// The session class uses the `NSURLSession.TaskRegistry` to keep track of its
/// tasks.
///
/// The task class uses an `InternalState` type together with `TransferState` to
/// keep track of its state and each transfer’s state -- note that a single task
/// may do multiple transfers, e.g. as the result of a redirect.
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// Most libcurl functions either return a `CURLcode` or `CURLMcode` which
/// are represented in Swift as `CFURLSessionEasyCode` and
/// `CFURLSessionMultiCode` respectively. We turn these functions into throwing
/// functions by appending `.asError()` onto their calls. This turns the error
/// code into `Void` but throws the error if it's not `.OK` / zero.
///
/// This is combined with `try!` is almost all places, because such an error
/// indicates a programming error. Hence the pattern used in this code is
///
/// ```
/// try! someFunction().asError()
/// ```
///
/// where `someFunction()` is a function that returns a `CFURLSessionEasyCode`.
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// The NSURLSession has a libdispatch ‘work queue’, and all internal work is
/// done on that queue, such that the code doesn't have to deal with thread
/// safety beyond that. All work inside a `NSURLSessionTask` will run on this
/// work queue, and so will code manipulating the session's *multi handle*.
///
/// Delegate callbacks are, however, done on the passed in
/// `delegateQueue`. And any calls into this API need to switch onto the ‘work
/// queue’ as needed.
///
/// - SeeAlso: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/threadsafe.html
/// - SeeAlso: NSURLSession+libcurl.swift
///
/// The (publicly accessible) attributes of an `NSURLSessionTask` are made thread
/// safe by using a concurrent libdispatch queue and only doing writes with a
/// barrier while allowing concurrent reads. A single queue is shared for all
/// tasks of a given session for this isolation. C.f. `taskAttributesIsolation`.
///
/// ## HTTP and RFC 2616
///
/// Most of HTTP is defined in [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).
/// While libcurl handles many of these details, some are handled by this
/// NSURLSession implementation.
///
/// ## To Do
///
/// - TODO: Is is not clear if using API that takes a NSURLRequest will override
/// all settings of the NSURLSessionConfiguration or just those that have not
/// explicitly been set.
/// E.g. creating an NSURLRequest will cause it to have the default timeoutInterval
/// of 60 seconds, but should this be used in stead of the configuration's
/// timeoutIntervalForRequest even if the request's timeoutInterval has not
/// been set explicitly?
///
/// - TODO: We could re-use EasyHandles once they're complete. That'd be a
/// performance optimization. Not sure how much that'd help. The NSURLSession
/// would have to keep a pool of unused handles.
///
/// - TODO: Could make `workQueue` concurrent and use a multiple reader / single
/// writer approach if it turns out that there's contention.
